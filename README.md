## Some info about the website

**This website is built only to be a placeholder until my new website is complete.**

I originally tried building it using [Pico CSS](https://picocss.com), but I do not think i succeeded. I really only used the built-in colours like `pico-colors-indigo`. And I didn't even touch almost any of the other features.

After I realised that used almost none of its features, I quit. And I was not going to use Tailwind since it seemed really hard to set up. I rebuilt the site from scratch without a framework using old plain CSS. Even though it seems like a great framework, I think I would be better off sticking to the normal CSS.

After a two week break from the project, i finally came back to add a fantastic colour picker + dark mode using javascript.
