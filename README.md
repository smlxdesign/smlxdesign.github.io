## Some info about the website

This website is built to just be a placeholder until my new website is complete. I originally tried building it using [Pico CSS](https://picocss.com), but I do not think i succeeded. I really only used the built-in colours like `pico-colors-indigo`. And I didn't even touch almost any of the other features.

After I realised that used almost none of its features, I quit. And I was not going to use Tailwind since it seemed really hard to set up. I rebuilt the site from scratch without a framework using old plain CSS. Even though it seems like a great framework, I think I would be better off sticking to the normal CSS.

For this project I used social media icons from [simpleicons](https://simpleicons.org) and for the mail icon i used an icon from [Materials Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons). Then I used [CSS filter generator](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) by [Barrett Sonntag](https://codepen.io/sosuke) to convert the icon from black to the correct hex color.
